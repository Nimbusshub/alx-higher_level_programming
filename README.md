# Higher-level programming - Python

**Python** is a popular Programming language. It was created by **Guido van Rossum**, and released in **1991**.
This powerful programming Language was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.

**This Repository will contains projects and tasks written mostly in Python.**

A simple program implemented with Python is shown below:

```py
"""Prints the string in the print function to the stdout"""
print("Hello World")

"""basic implementation of list in python"""
a_list = [1, 2.5, "The School is open", 15j]

for i in a_list:
    print("{}".format(i)) #using format strings to print to the stdout
```

#### Outputs

```text
Hello World
1
2.5
The School is open
15j
```
